# Nion

> Re-imagination of rgraphql using code generation.

## Introduction

NOTE: This repository has been archived. The nion project has been merged into
the [magellan](https://github.com/rgraphql/magellan) project. What used to be
magellan exists on the #reflect branch.

Nion is a real-time graphql query engine. It uses code generation to bind your
query and resolver types to a schema ahead-of-time.
